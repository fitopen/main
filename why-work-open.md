**DRAFT**
* Project continuity even with contributors dropping out
* More eyes on processes, more than one person on the a task gets testing happening from the outset, people can share and boast of their contribution, people can grow in their learning and interaction, be part of something import.
* This project will benefit from working in the open as it's also about decentralisation. Unless all work processes are also decentralised then people will not be able to feel authenticity through the project.
* It should also iron out issues early on. This means that not everything will work smoothly but that by having early tester with in the design of the project build that people will begin to feel more comfortable with the way things work and build confiedence in their own ability to work in the open.
