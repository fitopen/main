Contribtion Guidelines

Version 1.0

Welcome to the Fit Open codebase. We're here to build a FOSS infrastructure for the endurance sports industry. Connecting sportspeople, with local authority's outdoor spaces, charities and not-for-profits they are raising money for, and the fitness service industry.

You can help out in a number of ways:

1. design a logo
2. help us create the website
3. share the news about this project with your networks
4. help us implement one of the modules of this infrastructure
5. create a Github issue with additions to our plans - we welcome your feedback
6. guide us - flag bugs and suggest enhancements
7. become a part of our community - Fit Open is being created as a social enterprise: owned and run by its community 
8. join us on social - Mastodon, Matrix
9. support others by helping them learn how we do things here

We're building a community that cares about each other and the health of the community. Be sure you familiarise yourself with our Code of Conduct. All community members, delivery partners, and suppliers are expected to observe and enact its guidelines.

We observe a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fitopen/main/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md). We work for the common good of the whole community, the project's advancement, and believe in aiming for real social impact.

Project Lead - for now this is @bunnybooboo but this in no BDLF governance project so this will likely change with time.
