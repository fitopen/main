## Code of Conduct

### Short Version
> FitOpen strives to be an encouraging and safe space for all. We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusiveness. We insist on full respect of all our members, our speakers, their respective organisations, their source code, the organising team, our hosts and their property.

**Participants violating this code of conduct may be expelled from events and/or our online community spaces at the discretion of the organisers.**

----------------------
### Long Version
FitOpen endeavours to be a positive and safe space for all regardless of gender, gender identity or gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, age, religion, level of education, social status, political views, or place of employment.

#### As a participant of this community and events, you agree:
* We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.
* We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
* To respect peopleâ€™s boundaries and identities.
* To refrain from using language that can be considered rude or inappropriate.
* To avoid using offensive topics as a form of humour.
* To encourage all people to learn, grow, and thrive.
* To welcome responsible and varied forms of expression.
* To not be rude or disrespectful.
* To strive to resolve any disagreements for the best of the group.
* To observe this is a collaborative space and our available time can rapidly disappear.

If you feel your voice has not been heard during this time of collaboration we highly suggest raising an issue here in Github. We endeavour to engage openly and transparently.

**FitOpen is a collaborative space for participants across the globe to learn about decentralised technologies.** It is:
* not a space to manipulate or control others
* not the time or place to flirt or behave in a sexual manner
* not the audience to listen to your personal political views
* not a space to sell your things

#### If you experience abuse, harassment, discrimination, or feel unsafe, please let an organiser know ASAP. The matter will be dealt with in the strictest of confidence. You can do this in person, via the Meetup contact form, or via their contact information listed below.
