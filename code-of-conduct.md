### Short Version
decen.tech strives to be an encouraging and safe space for all. We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusiveness. We insist on full respect of all our members, our speakers, their respective organisations, their source code, the organising team, our hosts and their property.

Participants violating this code of conduct may be expelled from events and/or our online community spaces at the discretion of the organisers.

### Long Version
decen.tech endeavours to be a positive and safe space for all regardless of gender, gender identity or gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance (including but not limited to body size), race, age, religion, level of education, social status, political views, or place of employment.

#### As a participant of this community and events, you agree:
* We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.
* We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
* To respect people’s boundaries and identities.

* To encourage all people to learn, grow, and thrive.
* To welcome responsible and varied forms of expression.
